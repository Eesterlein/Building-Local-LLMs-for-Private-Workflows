# 🤖 Building Local LLMs for Private Workflows

This repo showcases two fully offline, privacy-first AI projects built using **Ollama**, **LlamaIndex**, and open-source LLMs on a MacBook Pro M1 Max.

## 🚀 Project 1: Private Coding Copilot

A fast, private coding assistant that runs entirely on-device using:

- 🧠 `DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B` via Ollama
- ⌨️ Prompted directly through Terminal
- ⚡ No internet connection or cloud API required

**Sample Prompts:**
- “Write a Python function that checks if a number is prime”
- “Can you help me debug this error?”
- “Translate this Python code into JavaScript”


---

## 🗂️ Project 2: Internal Company Policy Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions based on internal policy docs using:

- 🧠 Ollama + Mistral for local LLM + embeddings
- 📚 LlamaIndex for document search
- 💻 Python CLI for user interaction

**Test Prompts:**
- “What is the maximum PTO carryover?”
- “What happens if I lose a company laptop?”
- “How do I report a safety hazard?”
